## 🏗️ Data Architecture

The project implements a Medallion Architecture with three layers: **Bronze**, **Silver**, and **Gold**:  

1. **Bronze Layer**: Raw data ingestion from source systems (CSV files) into SQL Server.  
2. **Silver Layer**: Data cleansing, standardization, and transformation for quality and consistency.  
3. **Gold Layer**: Business-ready data modeled into a star schema for reporting and analytics.
